Yarp Mouse
 "semi-dummy" yarp device that sends mouse commands through a port.
 sends /mouse X Y when mouse dragged
 sends "/mouse up" or "/mouse down" when mouse button is up/down
 opens a port called "/yarpMouse" and sends everything through it.
 
 Requires YarpProcessing_osx project to be in your workspace! (This avoids having copies of compiled dylibs!)
